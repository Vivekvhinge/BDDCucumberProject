# ExtentReports Configuration for Spark Reporter
# Place this file in your 'src/test/resources' directory.

# Enable the Spark Report generation.
extent.reporter.spark.start=true
# Define the output file name for the Spark Report.
# This file will be created inside the directory specified by 'basefolder.name'.
extent.reporter.spark.out=Spark.html

# Configuration for screenshots.
# 'screenshot.dir' is the directory where ExtentReports expects screenshots if they are external files.
# For scenario.attach(), screenshots are embedded directly, so this is less critical for embedding itself,
# but can be used if you also save screenshots to this path from your code.
screenshot.dir=Screenshots/
# 'screenshot.rel.path' is the relative path from the generated HTML report to the screenshot directory.
# This is used for linking if screenshots are saved as external files.
screenshot.rel.path=../Screenshots/

# Base folder for all Extent Reports. A unique timestamped subfolder will be created inside this.
# 'test-output' is a standard Maven directory for test results.
basefolder.name=test-output/SparkReport
# Date and time pattern for creating unique report folders for each test run.
# Example folder name: 'test-output/SparkReport/18-Jun-25 20-30-45'
basefolder.datetimepattern=d-MMM-yy HH-mm-ss
