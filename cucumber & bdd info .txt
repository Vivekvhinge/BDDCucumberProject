What is Behavior Driven Development (BDD) Testing
In BDD, test cases are written in a natural language that even non-programmers can read.
In BDD, whatever you write must go into Given-When-Then steps.
Given [Preconditions or Initial Context]
When [Event or Trigger]
Then [Expected output]
Example: Login feature test case
Given :URL of login page is open
When : user enter username, password and clicks on login button
Then : Home page shall be open

What is Cucumber
Cucumber is a testing approach which supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It explains the behavior of the application in a
 simple English text using Gherkin language.
Gherkin is a business readable language which helps you to describe business behavior without going into details of implementation.
In Cucumber, test cases are described in cucumber feature file. Feature file should have extension .feature and each feature file
should have only one feature.


Important Terms Used In Gherkin Language:

1.Feature[summary]
2.Background [define steps that are common to all the tests in the feature file]
3.Scenario [Title]
4.Given [Precondition]
5.When [Event/Action]
6.Then [Expected Output of Action]
7.And [add conditions to your steps]
8.But [add negative type comments]
9.Scenario Outline Examples

Project Structure:
Package
1. PageObject :in this any applications webpages is consider as separate application like login,home,dashboard webpage is consider 
as separate app,& for each webpage we maintain a separate class and we idenitfy webelement and actions in that .
2. Step Definition
3. Utilities
4.TestRunner
Folders:
Feature file
Target (Reports)
Updated pom.xml for project dependencies
created feature file (.feature) for login test feature  :in gherkin lang 
created pageobject class for login web page :with webelements and actions to perform method
created step definition file for feature file (login test feature) : to implents the feature file steps
created test runner file to run test case
Generated test report
